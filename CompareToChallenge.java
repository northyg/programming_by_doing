compareTo() Challenge
Write a program that compares several Strings using the compareTo() method. You should display the Strings and display the integer that compareTo() gives you.

You must have five examples which result in a number less than 0, five examples which result in a number greater than 0, and two examples which give you exactly 0. 
This means you need a total of twelve examples.

You may not just flip the Strings around; you must have twelve different examples.

The Java String compareTo() method is used for comparing two strings lexicographically. 
Each character of both the strings is converted into a Unicode value for comparison. 
If both the strings are equal then this method returns 0 else it returns positive or negative value.
The result is positive if the first string is lexicographically greater than the second string else the result would be negative.
